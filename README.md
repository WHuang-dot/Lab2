SpotifyChartReport

This program program creates a txt file that report the top streamed music artists during certain week. The data used in thei program is from the spotify top chart csv file.
I used the regex technique to read the data from the csv file. The program creates a txt file that shows the total songs recorded, total artist in the chart,
the list of the artist, and how many times they appear in the chart. I also created an getHighest class to get the highest count of the same artist appear in the chart.
